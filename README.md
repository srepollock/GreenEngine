# Green Engine

A C++ game engine created in my 7th term at BCIT with my project group. I have
stripped our original engine and have begun to modify and replace it myself. I
hope to have a finished version one day, but as of now it's a side project I
will continue to work on over time myself with the help of others of course. No
final plans with it as of yet, but it will be good to have an ongoing project
and something that I am excited about. I have no huge features as of yet, but
I will keep my eyes open to issues for ideas and comments.
